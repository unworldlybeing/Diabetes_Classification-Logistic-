ðŸ©º Diabetes Classification using Machine Learning
Author: Ojaswa Pratap Singh
Status: Completed â€” Beginner ML Project
Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is likely to be diabetic based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which is widely used in introductory ML classification tasks.

This is one of my first projects in Machine Learning, completed within the first week of learning. It helped me understand how to:

Clean and preprocess data

Train a classification model

Evaluate performance

Save and reuse trained models

ðŸ“Š Dataset Details
Source: Kaggle - Pima Indians Diabetes Database

Samples: 768 female patients

Features: 8 diagnostic measurements (e.g. glucose, BMI, insulin, etc.)

Target: Outcome â€” 0 (non-diabetic) or 1 (diabetic)

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas and NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation

Pickle for saving the trained model

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Approach
Data Preprocessing

Handled zero values in certain features as missing data

Imputed missing values with mean

Model Used

Random Forest Classifier

Model Evaluation

Accuracy Score

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Model Deployment

Model saved using pickle for future use or deployment

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Accuracy: Achieved a good level of classification accuracy on the test data.

The model was able to classify diabetic vs non-diabetic patients with reasonable performance.
